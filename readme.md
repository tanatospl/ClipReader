ClipReader
==========

Super simple but very useful application written in C# using Microsoft's Speech API (SAPI).
The application docks in system tray and reads any text you copy to clipboard (CTRL+C)
It's very helpful with reading large amounts of text like science papers, tech documentation etc. 

* You can change the speed of reading by moving the slider. 
* You can change the voice / language of the reader in the system's Control Panel -> Speech Recognition -> Text to Speech.
* Here's how you can install more voices / languages: http://superuser.com/a/872573

---------
I created this piece of software many years ago in just a few hours, but it's still a super useful tool for fast learning so I decided to share it with the world.
